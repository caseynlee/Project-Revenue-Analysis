# Project-Revenue-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes sales performance across different sales channels using the US Regional Sales dataset from Kaggle. The analysis focuses on comparing revenue performance, profitability, and customer behavior patterns between four primary sales channels: Distributor, Online, Wholesale, and In-Store. The goal is to identify which sales channels are most effective in different regions and customer segments to optimize channel strategy and resource allocation.

The dataset contains comprehensive sales data across multiple US regions with detailed information on sales channels, customer segments, product categories, and financial metrics. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights for sales channel optimization and strategic decision-making to maximize revenue and profitability across different distribution methods.

## Business Goals/Description

- Compare sales channel performance across Distributor, Online, Wholesale, and In-Store channels to identify the most profitable and effective distribution methods
- Identify revenue optimization opportunities by understanding which channels drive highest sales volume and profit margins
- Develop channel-specific strategies based on order patterns and profitability analysis
- Optimize resource allocation by investing more heavily in high-performing channels and improving underperforming ones
- Improve channel mix to maximize overall business profitability and market reach

## Project Goals
Answer the question: Which sales channel generates the highest revenue and profitability? How do customer preferences and buying behavior differ across Distributor, Online, Wholesale, and In-Store channels?

- Conduct comprehensive channel analysis to understand performance differences across all four sales channels
- Compare profitability metrics across channels including profit margins, total revenue, order quantity, and discount impacts
- Develop channel-specific insights and recommendations for optimization and growth
- Create interactive dashboards for ongoing channel performance monitoring and comparison

## Executive Summary
The US Regional In-Stores Channel analysis reveals critical insights for sales channel optimization.
Key findings include (in order of business impact):

- Channel performance: In-store channel generates highest average order value ($46.66 avg) but Wholesale channel shows lowest average order value ($12.13). The Distributor channel has the huge decrease in gap for the sum of unit price by year.  
- Profitability analysis: In-Store channel demonstrates highest profit margins and returns a revenue of $5.5M while Wholesale channel shows lowest revenue of $1.35M

The analysis identified that optimizing channel mix and implementing channel-specific strategies could increase overall profitability by 18-25% while maintaining or increasing total sales volume.
